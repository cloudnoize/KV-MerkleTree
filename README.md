# KV-Merkle

**KV-Merkle** is a **Sparse Merkle Tree** that integrates features from Patricia trees, Jellyfish trees, and Sparse Merkle Trees while introducing novel enhancements. Unlike traditional Merkle trees, KV-Merkle:

- Supports **arbitrary-length keys** without requiring hashing.
- Preserves **lexicographic order**, enabling **efficient range queries** and **range deletions**.
- Reduces tree height with **extensions** that collapse common prefixes.
- Operates **independently** from the key-value store, allowing **parallel verification**.
- Provides **optimized caching** with a **1-to-1 memory-disk mapping**.
- Uses **nil node optimization** for compact storage and smaller proofs.

This makes KV-Merkle an ideal choice for **verifiable key-value storage** with efficient range operations.
